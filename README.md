# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, on git so I can quickly add sensible config to new machines/servers/etc, and roll back changes that broke something if necessary (although hopefully not necessary).

Shared here so you can browse through and get ideas. (And everyone needs a dotfiles repo hey?)


## installing

dotfiles are managed and installed with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)
