# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, including other setup tasks such as installing software, creating directories, etc.
Shared here so you can browse through and get ideas. And everyone needs a dotfiles repo hey?

Copyright © 2017 Samuel Walladge


## Installing

Dotfiles are managed and installed with [rcm](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm).

```bash
# install rcm for your platform - eg:
pacaur -y rcm

cd
git clone git@github.com:swalladge/dotfiles.git
RCRC=~/dotfiles/rcrc rcup

# note that future runs of rcup don't require the RCRC var
```

### Post install tasks

- run `:PlugInstall` in vim/nvim to install plugins

## Notes

- run `mkrc ~/path/to/.file` to quickly track a new dotfile. See [rcm blog
  post](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/rcm-for-rc-files-in-dotfiles-repos) and
  [github repo](https://github.com/thoughtbot/rcm) for more info on management
  commands.
