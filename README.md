# dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, on git so I can quickly add sensible config to new machines/servers/etc, and roll back changes that broke something if necessary (although hopefully not necessary).

Shared here so you can browse through and get ideas. (And everyone needs a dotfiles repo hey?)


## installing

dotfiles are managed and installed with [ansible](https://www.ansible.com/).

- run `ansible-playbook dotfiles-install.yaml` to install

It will also make sure dependencies are installed.

## TODO

- Install ruby dependencies - ie with `gem install tmuxinator` (but use the gem module in ansible)

- split out a minimal set of dotfiles for small servers, etc.


### post install tasks

- run `:PlugInstall` in vim/nvim to install plugins
