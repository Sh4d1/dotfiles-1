# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, on git so I can quickly add sensible config to new machines/servers/etc, and roll back changes that broke something if necessary (although hopefully not necessary).

Shared here so you can browse through and get ideas. (And everyone needs a dotfiles repo hey?)


## installing

dotfiles are managed and installed with [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot)

- run `./install -c <config file>` from in repo to populate symlinks for dotfiles (chose correct config file!)


### dependencies

- ruby
- vim (or gvim) (actually neovim is recommended)
- python (version 3)
- python-pip

Plus all the other apps...

- install most through package manager (`pacman -S ...`)
- `gem install tmuxinator`
- `pip install --user i3pystatus`

### install config files

- `install.macbook.conf.yaml` - installs all config along with some macbook specific files (from `macbook` dir), designed for my macbook
- `install.conf.yaml` - main config which installs everything, designed for my desktop
