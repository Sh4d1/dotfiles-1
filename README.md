# Dotfiles

These are my dotfiles, including other setup tasks such as installing software, creating directories, etc.

Shared here so you can browse through and get ideas. And everyone needs a dotfiles repo hey?

## Installing

Dotfiles are managed and installed with [Salt](https://saltstack.com/).

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:swalladge/dotfiles.git
cd dotfiles
./install.sh
```

It will also make sure dependencies are installed, etc.

The pillar configuration variables should be entered into `pillar/custom.sls` (this file is created from `default.sls`
and opened in an editor by `install.sh`).
